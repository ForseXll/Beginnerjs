                <p>"Are you getting my texts???" she texted to him. He glanced at it and chuckled under his breath. Of
                    course he was getting them, but if he wasn't getting them, how would he ever be able to answer? He
                    put the phone down and continued on his project. He was ignoring her texts and he planned to
                    continue to do so.</p>

                <p>Josh had spent year and year accumulating the information. He knew it inside out and if there was
                    ever anyone looking for an expert in the field, Josh would be the one to call. The problem was that
                    there was nobody interested in the information besides him and he knew it. Years of information
                    painstakingly memorized and sorted with not a sole giving even an ounce of interest in the topic.

                <p>MaryLou wore the tiara with pride. There was something that made doing anything she didn't really
                    want to do a bit easier when she wore it. She really didn't care what those staring through the
                    window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment.</p>

                <p>Don't forget that gifts often come with costs that go beyond their purchase price. When you purchase
                    a child the latest smartphone, you're also committing to a monthly phone bill. When you purchase the
                    latest gaming system, you're likely not going to be satisfied with the games that come with it for
                    long and want to purchase new titles to play. When you buy gifts it's important to remember that
                    some come with additional costs down the road that can be much more expensive than the initial gift
                    itself.</p>
