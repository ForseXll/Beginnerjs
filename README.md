My JavaScript Practice.


I started my own portfolio with react.js. I realized that the syntax of the code was bothering me and I didnâ€™t know the basics. Since React is written in simple JavaScript, I decided to take a JavaScript course in order to understand the front-end development and practice Syntax. Most of these assignments were provided by the course, although they inspired me to go a little extra play around and add my own style and create my own pages. 

This is course from https://beginnerjavascript.com/.
